# About Me
> I am an Indian born American who moved to this amazing country in 2014 and fell in love with ever since. One of the most the exciting part about this country is backcountry hikes and mountain ranges, from Appalachian to Rocky Mountains. My dream is to climb all the highest mountain ranges on east coast and west coast. So far, I have climbed Mt. Lafayette(5,249′) and Mt. Washington(6,288′) in New Hampshire, Old Rag in Virginia and many more.  
> Other than nature, I also love learning about new technology and gadgets. Recently, I am very much interested in learning about [NuralLink]( https://neuralink.com). I think that is something which has potential to breakthrough current human capabilities. I have been also found of bringing medical science and computer science together.  If you compare our nervous system to computer, it is very similar in the sense that, computer keyboard acts as sensory neurons and display as motor neurons. And CPU can be part of brain which handles the logic.
