## What I learned from the workshop?
- Data Scientists spend at least 70-80% of their time retrieving and cleaning the data. Which include imputation and Data processing.
- Most of the time statisticians struggle to write python code.
- [EZAnalytix](https://ce.ezanalytix.com/index) is a powerful website which gives easy drag and drop feature to clean and analyze the data. 

## How to choose sample size?
- In EZAnalytix, use the Power Analysis feature to choose sample size. It is the most used feature of the website.
